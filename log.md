# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## ðŸ—“Day0: 1st March, 2020
------------------------

### Today's Progress: 

- Started work on the Style Transfer App with Pytorch and Flask.

### Thoughts: 
- Really taking advantage of technology spikes that are well documented. It makes future projects that use the same tech a lot more repeatable.
- I should look into creating my own Github templates for different tech and frameworks seeing as it's going to speed up my challenge going forward
